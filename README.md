This was inspired after reading a post from [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/)

I really liked the simulation so I tried running it myself. I wanted to simulate death.. play around with other variables like, slowing down when you're infected and severe, etc.

To run it locally

1. npm install
2. npm run serve
